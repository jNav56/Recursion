# Recursion

In this project, we have two projects. The first project file Recursive.java holds methods that solve common problems that I solve with recursion such as mnemonics, drawing sierpinski carpets, manipulating strings, and finding a path out of a maze. The second project file AnagramSolver.java involves creating a list of anagrams for a given input. 

There are two projects in this repository, but both have to do with getting familiar with recursion and dividing big problems into smaller problems.

## Key Feautures

- Programmed in Java
- Used Recursion Implementations
- Used ArrayList Implementations
- Used Tree Map Implementations
- Utilized Sets
- Utilized Graphics

## Data Structure Class

This course deepened my knowledge of software design through the lenses of an object-oriented perspective. I learned to implemented commmon data structures to organize and manipulate data such as linked lists, recursion, binary trees, and hash tables to list a few. I was made aware of the tradeoffs software developers have to deal with when designing projects and how to handle them. The class also allowed students to explore algorithms and structures in standard code.
